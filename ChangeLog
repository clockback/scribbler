# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## Unreleased
## [0.0.7] - 2021-04-16
### Added
- Creating .PNG glyphs for a font.
- Creating a font renderer and corresponding text object.
- The InteractComponent will, when its entity is hovered over, display a piece
  of text identifying the entity.

### Fixed
- Ensuring that the cursor is displayed in the right place, irrespective of the
  scaling value.
- Likewise ensuring that the entity over which the entity is hovering works for
  any scaling value.
- Fixed bug which caused unwalkable tiles on the border to have game-breaking
  click events when the mouse was closer to the border than the other side.
- Fixed bug causing the journey component to fail to assign the
  MappedComponent's tile's plane and the MappedComponent's plane to the same
  plane, resulting in somewhat rare but unusual plane-hopping.

## [0.0.6] - 2021-04-12
### Added
- Introducing an InteractComponent to compliment the ClickComponent. Presently,
  it introduces a state in the system according to which entity the user is
  possibly clicking on.
- The top-most entity with the cursor hovering over it affects the cursor.
- Two new images for the cursor. The default has been hidden.

### Fixed
- Previously, if an entity was walking towards an interaction point, then their
  movement was interrupted, they would retain the facing direction at the end
  of their walk. This has been removed.

## [0.0.5] - 2021-04-11
### Added
- Entities can now be clicked on for different behaviour to normal path
  finding. The player now walks below an entity when the entity is clicked
  upon, unless there is a user-defined interaction tile which indicates where
  the user must interact with the entity.
- When an unwalkable tile is selected, a bordering tile can contextually be
  allocated to the user instead.
- Copyright notices.
- Inclusion of GPLv3.
- Giving entities optional but unique id names.

### Fixed
- Using pow instead of powf when operating on doubles.
- Quick sort no longer fails when operating on arrays of less than two items.

## [0.0.4] - 2021-04-08
### Added
- Visual scaling is now automatically handled for any entity with a
  MappedComponent, and either a SpriteComponent or an AnimationComponent unless
  otherwise specified.

## [0.0.3] - 2021-04-08
### Added
- Each entity can now have its scale adjusted, whether through the
  AnimateComponent or the SpriteComponent.

### Changed
- The graphics are now rendered on a smaller screen, which is then scaled to a
  larger size to fit the window.

## [0.0.2] - 2021-04-07
### Added
- Using quicksort algorithm to sort entities in the world (as opposed to text,
  overlay, etc.) for display.
- Simple demonstration on a rubbish bin. The character can walk in front of and
  behind the bin.

### Changed
- The shoes shown in the images for the main character have been fixed.

### Fixed
- Forgot to set the number of planes to zero in a room upon initialization,
  resulting in run-time errors.

## [0.0.1] - 2021-04-05
### Added
- Entity-component system implemented with following components:
    - Mapped: The coordinates of the entity. Can be locked to a plane,
      therefore not necessarily the coordinates of the plane.
    - Move: The velocity of the entity. Operates on the Mapped entity.
    - Sprite: A single image used for a component.
    - Journey: A path-finder. Sets destinations for the entity and manipulates
      the Move component in order to reach them.
    - Animate: A collection of indexed images which are applied contextually.
- Rooms, which contain planes, which contain tiles, which contain tile edges.
- Simple pixel-art for a character.
