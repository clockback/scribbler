## Unreleased

## [0.0.1] - 2021-04-05
### Added
- Entity-component system implemented with following components:
    - Mapped: The coordinates of the entity. Can be locked to a plane,
      therefore not necessarily the coordinates of the plane.
    - Move: The velocity of the entity. Operates on the Mapped entity.
    - Sprite: A single image used for a component.
    - Journey: A path-finder. Sets destinations for the entity and manipulates
      the Move component in order to reach them.
    - Animate: A collection of indexed images which are applied contextually.
- Rooms, which contain planes, which contain tiles, which contain tile edges.
- Simple pixel-art for a character.
